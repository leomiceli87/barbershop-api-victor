### What is this project?

####

This project is a documentation for a Barbershop API. An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a messenger between different systems. It allows different systems to communicate with each other and exchange data.

### How does it work?

####

Imagine you're at a barbershop, and you want to book an appointment. You can do this by talking to the receptionist, who will then book the appointment for you. In this scenario, you are the "client" (the one who wants to book an appointment), and the receptionist is the "server" (the one who has the information and can book the appointment).

In the digital world, APIs work in a similar way. Instead of talking to a receptionist, a computer program (like a website or a mobile app) sends a "request" to the API, saying "Hey, I want to book an appointment!" The API then processes this request and sends back a "response", saying "Okay, your appointment is booked!"

### Technologies involved

####

Here are some of the technologies involved in this project:

#### RESTful API

#####

This is a type of API that uses simple and consistent URLs to interact with the system. It's like a set of instructions that says "Hey, if you want to book an appointment, send a request to this URL!"

#### JSON

#####

This is a type of data format that is used to exchange data between systems. It's like a simple text file that contains information about the appointment, like the date, time, and user details.

#### HTTP

#####

This is a protocol that is used to send requests and responses between systems. It's like a set of rules that says "Hey, if you want to send a request, use this format!"

#### Authentication and Authorization

#####

This is a way to secure the API by checking who is making the request and what they are allowed to do. It's like a security guard who checks your ID and makes sure you're allowed to book an appointment.
